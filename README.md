# nmpc_nmhe_mFxFylearning
ROS packages for Nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) and nonlinear moving horizon estimator (NMHE).The resulting (high-level) NMPC tracks the commanded position trajectory while expecting the learned values for $m$, $F_{xDist}$, and $F_{yDist}$. Whereas, NMHE learn these parameters and feed them to NMPC. 

**Usage:**
1. roslaunch nmpc_pc_mfxfylearning_pkg nmpc_pc_mfxfylearning.launch
2. roslaunch nmhe_mfxfylearning_pkg nmhe_mfxfylearning.launch

Moreover, the following package can be used to command the reference trajectory:\
[trajectories](https://github.com/mohit004/trajectories): A ROS package to generate reference trajectories.

These NMPC and NMHE packages are utilized in the following works. Please don't forget to consider citing them if you use these codes in your work.
